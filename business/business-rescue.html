        <h1>Business Rescue</h1>
        <h2 class="serviceHeading">Don’t jump ship just yet. Come on LET’S save it</h2>

    <h2>Business rescue according to the companies act</h2>
    <p>
        Business rescue aims to facilitate the rehabilitation of a company that is financially distressed by providing for the temporary supervision
        of the company and management of its affairs, business and property by a business rescue practitioner. The business rescue process creates a
        temporary moratorium (“stay”) on the rights of creditors against the company or in respect of property in its possession through the
        development and implementation of a business rescue plan to rescue the company by restructuring its affairs. Speed is of the essence in the
        business rescue process as very short time periods are set out in the new Companies Act, and it is important that all affected parties have
        access to competent insolvency, business rescue & restructuring lawyers who can be called upon at a moment’s notice.
    </p>
    <h2>WHEN IS BUSINESS RESCUE APPROPRIATE?</h2>
    <p>
        Often businesses suffer a financial loss of some sort resulting in short term cashflow problems leaving them unable to pay their creditors as
        they become due. Although your business cannot meet its current financial obligations, the business is viable, projections look good and the
        business will be able to trade out of its current financially distressed situation, if given some “breathing space”. This is where the process
        of Business Rescue comes in. The aim of business rescue is to restructure the affairs of a company in such a way that either maximises the
        likelihood of the company continuing in existence on a solvent basis, or results in a better return for the creditors or shareholders of the
        company than would ordinarily result from the liquidation of the company.
    </p>
    <h2 class="strong-heading"><b>BACK TO BASICS</b></h2>
    <h2>How to run a profitable business. This is how the pro’s do it</h2>
    <p>Anton Rupert once said that if you want to make your business profitable, you need to do seven things. The first three are homework, homework,
        and homework! In other words: market research. Rupert said that once you have determined that you have a product that is needed by enough
        people and can be sold at a profit, you have a business. The fourth thing you need in business is enough money to bridge the gap between idea
        and operation. This is where most businesses fail. If you start sailing and reach the middle of the dam, but you do not have enough petrol to
        reach the other side, you are worse off than when you started. Rupert says that once you reach the other side of the pond you need to do three
        things right in that company namely marketing, management and pricing. STICK TO THE BASICS
    </p>
    <h2>LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY continue in the following circumstances:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If written consent is given by the BRP;</li>
        <li>As a set-off in legal proceedings by the company;</li>
        <li>When the court has so ordered;</li>
        <li>Proceedings of any property or right which the company holds as trustee;</li>
        <li>Criminal proceedings against the company, its directors or officers are unaffected;</li>
        <li>A guarantee or surety by the company is unenforced without leave from the court.</li>
    </ul>
