    <h2>Is sequestration for you?</h2>
    <p>
        Deciding whether to sequestrate is not a decision to be taken lightly and many factors need to be considered before applying for the voluntary
        surrender of one’s estate. Schedule a <strong><a href="../contact-us.html">free appointment</a></strong> with us and during the consultation, we will assist you in determining whether sequestration
        is indeed the right option for you. Should you want to proceed with sequestration, there are a lot of legal formalities which we then take care of.

    <br />

    <h2>START FRESH & DEBT FREE</h2>
    <p>
        Voluntary sequestration is an application that is made to the High Court to surrender your estate to the creditors. The estate initially vests in the Master of the
        High Court who must appoint a trustee to take control of the insolvent estate. The trustee must sell the assets according to the Insolvency Laws of South Africa and
        distribute the proceeds to creditors once the administration expenses have been settled.
    </p>

    <h2>EFFECTS OF SEQUESTRATION</h2>
    <p>
        The effect of a Voluntary Sequestration Court Order is that your creditors can no longer legally claim any payments from you, and they must then submit any claims
        which they may have to the trustee of your insolvent estate. Once the trustee is appointed, he/she takes control of the estate and executes the administrative tasks
        needed to finalise any claims against the estate.
    </p>

    <h2>Get an Insolvency Law specialist</h2>
    <p>
        Appoint an attorney who is an insolvency specialist. Insolvency Law is specialised, and an interesting fact is that Insolvency Law in many instances differs vastly
        from “normal” law. You will be able to establish this from the <a href="../frequently-asked-questions.html">FAQ’s</a>. <a href="../contact-us.html">Contact us</a> today for peace of mind and sleep soundly tonight.

    <br />

    <h2 class="strong-heading-center">SLEEP SOUNDLY TONIGHT, KNOWING THAT YOUR AFFAIRS ARE BEING HANDLED BY A PROFESSIONAL.</h2>
    <br>


    <h2>Feeling guilty</h2>
    <p>
        It is natural to feel guilty. We are only human at the end of the day. Nobody wants to default on their obligations. We all want to succeed and “live happily ever after”.
        Unfortunately, life is not a Disney fairy-tale and things go wrong. When you were asked as a child what you wanted to be when you grow up. No-one has ever answered,
        sequestrated! The sad reality is that life happens. You simply do not have control over every aspect of your life. The legislator knows this and therefore provision has
        been made in the law to get out of this debt spiral and start living again. Feeling guilty does not change the situation. Lift your head up high and move on.
        “<strong>GET UP, DRESS UP AND SHOW UP</strong>!”

    <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT DURING THE PROCESS OF VOLUNTARY SEQUESTRATION</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>CREDITORS CALL US</strong>
            <p>Don’t speak to me, speak to my lawyer. During the application for voluntary sequestration, you refer all creditors to us, and we will correspond with them</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>PEACE OF MIND</strong>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>START LIVING AGAIN</strong>
            <p>
                Money for groceries. Money for rent. Money for school fees. Money for petrol. The money which you save on not repaying your creditors can go toward your
                living expenses and other necessities
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

            <strong>LISTED ON CREDIT BUREAUS</strong>
            <p>

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>NOT CREDIT WORTHY</strong>
            <p>
                You may obtain credit during the sequestration period, provided your trustee approves such application and the
                credit provider is aware that you have been sequestrated
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
