            <p>
                Deciding whether or not to sequestrate is not a decision to be taken lightly and many factors need to be considered before applying for the
                voluntary surrender of one’s estate. Schedule a <a href="contact.html"><strong>free appointment</strong></a> with us and during the consultation, we will assist you in determining whether
                sequestration is indeed the right option for you. Should you want to proceed with sequestration, there are a lot of legal formalities which we
                then take care of.

        <div id="how-can-i-be-sequestration" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                There are three possibilities in which you can be sequestrated:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Voluntary surrender of estate
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This is the most common approach to sequestration. This is when you approach Court as the Applicant of your own sequestration.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Friendly sequestration
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This is the process where a friend or family member brings a sequestration application against you.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For lack of a better term we refer here to a “<strong>hostile sequestration</strong>” which is where one or more of your creditors apply to Court for your sequestration.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block faq-content-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#sequestration-process">How does the sequestration process work?</button>
        <div id="sequestration-process" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                A voluntary sequestration application is an application which is made to the High Court of South Africa wherein you “surrender” your estate consisting of assets and liabilities to your creditors.
                The Master of the High Court must then appoint a trustee to administer the insolvent estate and hold meetings where the creditors will have to prove their claims against your estate. The Trustee
                is tasked with the sale of the assets in your estate and must then distribute the proceeds between the group of creditors equally. You do not have to appear in person and during the process, you
                are protected against execution by your creditors.
            </p>

                The firm is built on service and success! We cannot guarantee that your application will be successful. However, we know what the law and the Courts require for an application to succeed and we
                do not bring an application unless we are confident that a proper case is made to succeed. We have dealt with hundreds of insolvency cases which have all been successful.

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block faq-content-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#benefit-for-creditors">What is a <i>benefit for creditors</i> and how is it calculated?</button>
        <div id="benefit-for-creditors" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                According to the Insolvency Act it must be “to the benefit of your creditors” if you sequestrate. In layman’s terms this means that you must prove to the Court that your creditors are, for as long as
                you are not sequestrated, prejudiced. The creditors that do not hold any security must each receive a dividend of at least twenty cents in the rand. Over and above these requirements, there must also
                be enough assets or cash in the insolvent estate to ensure that the administrative costs of the estate are paid.

        <div id="too-poor-to-sequestrate" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                <strong>Yes</strong> indeed. If you cannot provide a “benefit for creditors”, the Court will not grant a sequestration order.
            </p>

        <div id="guilty" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                It is natural to feel guilty. We are only human at the end of the day. Nobody wants to default on their obligations. We all want to succeed and “live happily ever after”. Unfortunately, life is not a
                Disney fairy-tale and things go wrong. When you were asked as a child what you wanted to be when you grow up. No-one has ever answered, sequestrated! The sad reality is that life happens. You simply
                do not have control over every aspect of your life. The legislator knows this and therefore provision has been made in the law to get out of this debt spiral and start living again. Feeling guilty does
                not change the situation. Lift your head up high and move on. <strong>“GET UP, DRESS UP AND SHOW UP!”</strong>

            <p>
                Do not try to negotiate to them yourself. Don’t speak to me. Speak to my lawyer. That’s all you have to say. They will call you, threaten you, or do any other legal or illegal thing to convince you to
                pay them. You might even hear from them that if you don’t pay, they will have you arrested. Don’t be intimidated. Get professional help.

            <p>
                During the 90’s a toy company in America interviewed children. They wanted to determine if children could give them ideas for the ultimate toy. One of the questions was to name the animal they feared
                the most. A Dragon! The answer was outrageous because dragons do not exist! What we learn from this is that people fear the unknown. It is our experience that most clients do not know and thus are
                afraid. Call us and we will let you know whether your fear is real or simply a fictitious dragon.

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block faq-content-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#wait-for-creditors">Why don’t I simply wait for my creditors to sequestrate me?</button>
        <div id="wait-for-creditors" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                Creditors are not keen to bring a “hostile” Sequestration Application against you, because it is usually cheaper for them to follow legal action via summons, judgement and execution by the Sheriff.
                That being said, it is not impossible for a creditor to bring an application for your sequestration. However, hostile sequestration Applications are mostly brought against debtors who have very large
                estates and who have hidden their assets from creditors. In our experience creditors who bring hostile applications for smaller amounts mainly include individuals, body corporates / home owners
                associations and schools.

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block faq-content-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#difference">What is the difference between <i>sequestration</i>, <i>bankruptcy</i>, <i>liquidation</i>, <i>insolvency</i> and <i>surrender of estate</i> ?</button>
        <div id="difference" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                “Sequestration”, “bankruptcy” “insolvency” and “liquidation” are all different terms, which in layman’s terms simply mean that a person or business is in such a bad financial state that creditors
                cannot get paid. The term “liquidation” refers to the insolvency of a company or close corporation. The term “sequestration” refers to the insolvency of a natural person or a trust. “Surrender of estate”
                refers to the process whereby a natural person approaches the court to be declared insolvent.
            </p>

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block faq-content-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#what-is-trustee">What is a: <i>Trustee</i>, <i>Liquidator</i> and <i>Curator</i> ?</button>
        <div id="what-is-trustee" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                Most people believe that these terms are all synonyms and they are used interchangeably. However, each one of these terms have a specific legal meaning and place in our law. Once a natural person is
                sequestrated the Master of the High Court appoints a Trustee who must take control of the assets. In the case of a Company/CC liquidation, the person appointed by the Master is referred to as a
                Liquidator. A Curator can either be appointed as a guardian of the assets of an institution like an Art Gallery/Museum or he can be appointed as guardian of a person who does not have the mental
                capacity to take care of their own financial affairs. The term Curator is often mistakenly used when referring to a Trustee or Liquidator.

            <p>
                The Master of the High Court is a government institution which is the guardian (the godfather) of all insolvents, minor children and the estates of deceased persons. All curators, trustees, liquidators
                and executors report to the Master in the execution of their duties.

            <p>
                A Secured Creditor is a creditor which holds security for the debt. Examples include a mortgage bond registered over your property, motorcar/asset finance etc. He stands first in line if the asset is
                sold. Apart from these creditors certain statutory creditors are preferent for example the taxman, employees, TV licenses, costs owing to your doctor on your deathbed etc.

            <p>
                Concurrent creditors are those creditors who do not hold any security for the money you owe them. In practice these creditors are at the back of the queue when it comes to receiving a dividend from
                the Insolvent estate.

            <p>
                Debt Counselling is a process whereby a person approaches a debt councillor who may assist him, by approaching the Magistrate Court, to rearrange his debt payments. A company and Close Corporation

                No. Remember the “dragons” I was telling you about? It is interesting to know that only as recently as 1923 it was finally decided that insolvency in South Africa is a civil matter and not a criminal
                matter (Ex parte Pretorius). Before 1994 you could, in fact, be jailed for non-payment of debt. A debtor could not be put in jail because he owed money, but the creditor’s attorney would take the debtor
                to Court and would ask the Magistrate to make an Order in terms whereof the debtor should pay a certain amount per month. Should the debtor fail to make that payment he could be jailed for not complying
                with the Court Order. After 1994 the law has changed, and a debtor can’t be jailed for non-payment.

                The general rule is that the share registered in your name forms part of the insolvent estate. The trustee must sell all the assets of the insolvent estate. In practice, the person/s who owns the
                “other undivided share” in the immovable property is typically the purchaser. This is because he/she has signed surety for the full outstanding bond jointly and severally with you when the property
                was originally purchased. The alternative is that the property is sold, and the proceeds are distributed equally between the joint owners and the insolvent estate. This could be confusing and if
                applicable to your situation we will be able to advise you on the possible scenarios and solutions thereto.

            <p>
                Once you are sequestrated no creditor may attach your salary, either by emolument attachment order, garnishee or by simply “grabbing” your salary from your bank account. Your Trustee however does
                have the discretion, in terms of Section 23(5) of the Insolvency Act, to attach any part of your salary which the Trustee deems unnecessary for your normal expenditure. We have always succeeded in
                negotiating with the Trustee to exclude our client’s income from the Insolvent Estate.

                furniture to be excluded from the Insolvent Estate. The worst-case scenario is that your furniture is appraised, and you must buy back your furniture from your Insolvent Estate, while the furniture
                stays in your possession. The “insolvency value” of furniture is very low because it is evaluated at a forced sale value, such as when it is sold in execution by a sheriff.

                In terms of Section 82(6) of the Insolvency Act, your trustee is <strong>not allowed to take your tools of trade</strong>. Bear in mind, that if the assets (tools) are under finance, ownership has

                Before the Laws on firearms became more stringent, firearms were considered to be an asset in an insolvent estate. Due to these stringent laws, Trustees find it difficult to take control of and sell

                If your car is financed, it vests in the insolvent estate. Most clients buy a vehicle from a friend or family member on a private sale. Many people who are insolvent or are listed on credit bureaus
                enter into agreements where a third party finances the vehicle in their name and the insolvent maintains the monthly instalments on the vehicle as a type of “rental” for the vehicle. If you have a
                vehicle in your insolvent estate which is paid off, we will, in so far as possible negotiate with your trustee for you to buy back the vehicle from the insolvent estate.

                The general rule is that ownership of movable assets is confirmed by possession of the assets and ownership of immovable property is confirmed by registration. According to South African law, ownership
                is determined by facts. This means that just because a motorcar is registered in my name does not mean that I am the owner. If someone claims ownership of the vehicle then it must be proven on a
                balance of probabilities that the vehicle does in fact belong to that person. This will be determined by answering the following questions:
                <ul>

                As part of the voluntary sequestration application an advertisement must be placed in the Government Gazette. Once the publication of your intention to sequestrate has appeared in the Government
                Gazette, no creditor can sell any of your assets, even if the execution process against you has gone so far that the Sheriff has attached your assets. The legislator intended to prohibit your creditors

                If the debt became due and payable and the creditor has not issued summons against you in 3 years, the debt is prescribed, and this may be raised as a defence should the creditor then issue summons to
                collect the debt. Just because your name does not appear on any of the credit bureaus does not mean that the debt is written off. Magistrate’s Court judgements are valid for 30 years and High court
                judgements are valid for the rest of your life. In practice, often the attorney tasked to collect the debt cannot do so, because the debtor is unable to pay, and he has no assets which can be sold.
                The attorney then advises his client to let it be and he closes his file. Then, years later, the creditor executes against you or sells the judgement debt to another creditor who comes knocking.

                This happens quite often and usually occurs where clients have moved. When you obtain credit and sign an agreement, you choose a legal address called “domicile” address at which the creditor must serve
                any legal documents including a summons. There after it is legally accepted that you have received the summons at that address, whether you still live there or not. The service was legal, and the
                judgement taken is also legal.

            <p>
                <strong>Monthly Income and Expenditure Statement</strong> - You are required to submit a monthly income and expenditure statement to your Trustee. This is usually required for 12 months.

            <p>
                <strong>New Income Tax number</strong> - The Income Tax Act requires that you apply for a new income tax number as your old number will be linked to your insolvent estate and any monies due to you or

                <strong>Creditors Meeting</strong> - You are required to attend the meeting of creditors which will be held at either the offices of the Master of the High Court or at your local Magistrate’s Court. This is simply for
                creditors to prove their claims in the estate and is not an opportunity for them to interrogate you. One of the reasons you must attend these meetings is because you have first-hand knowledge of the
                amounts due to creditors and you can assist the trustee to disregard false claims against your estate.

            <p>
                Typically, the trustee who has the most support from the creditors is appointed. This transpires on the basis that he must have rallied the support of creditors in number and value. “Number” being the
                number of creditors and “value” being the value of the debt. For example, if you have ten creditors and a certain trustee has rallied the support of the majority of creditors he will be appointed. If
                the trustee was also supported in value, for example, your total debt is R100,000.00 and the trustee has the support of creditors who’s claims amount to R50,001.00, that trustee will be appointed.
                Therefore, the possibility does exist that two trustees can be appointed in one estate.

        <div id="disposition-without-value" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                Certain legal actions by an insolvent prior to his sequestration are defined as a disposition without value. This type of transaction can be set aside by the trustee and the assets which were disposed
                of can be repossessed by the trustee. The main feature of such a disposition is that there was no legal obligation on the insolvent to dispose of the asset. An example is where you would simply transfer
                an asset to someone who did not have a legal claim on the asset. Should a trustee wish to set aside such a disposition, the trustee must prove that:
                <ul>
                    <li>the insolvent has of his own free will disposed of the asset;</li>
                    <li>that the disposition was made in favour of another person; and</li>
                    <li>he insolvent received no or insufficient quid pro quo for the asset.</li>
                </ul>
                Once a trustee is appointed he should determine whether dispositions were made. If these dispositions were made, the trustee must determine whether the disposition was made within two years before the
                sequestration or longer ago than two years. If the disposition was made more than two years ago, the trustee must prove that the insolvent’s assets were less than his liabilities directly after the
                disposition and he must also prove that the insolvent did not receive a proper quid pro quo for the transaction.
                <br />
                If the disposition was made within two years before sequestration, the burden of proof that the disposal cannot be set aside vests in the insolvent and/or the person who has received the benefit.
                They must prove that either the insolvent’s assets exceeded his liabilities directly after the disposition, failing which, he must prove that he has received a proper counter value when disposing of
                the asset. Section 26 does not try to inhibit the normal conduct of business. It prohibits extraordinary transactions.

                It is common practice for spouses to make donations to each other in terms of Antenuptial contracts. All donations made in terms of a prenuptial contract can be set aside unless the spouse who has
                received the benefit from his/her insolvent spouse proves the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>The donation in terms of the prenuptial contract brought an immediate benefit to the solvent spouse within three months after the date of marriage; and</li>

                    <li>The benefit was given in good faith to a spouse or a child from the marriage; and</li>
                    <li>The insolvent’s estate is not sequestrated within two years after the disposition in terms of the prenuptial contract was made. Should you be able to prove all the above, it is deemed that
                        there was no legal disposition made.

            <p>
                Should the trustee prove that there was a voidable disposition, the disposition becomes nil and void. Section 29 envisages a proper pro rata division of the assets of the insolvent amongst his creditors.
                A disposition of Section 29 differs from a disposition in terms of Section 26 in that the disposition under Section 29 has been made to one of the insolvent’s creditors, whereas a disposition under
                Section 26 has been made to someone who was not a creditor of the insolvent. If a trustee wishes to succeed in setting aside such a disposition, he must prove the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>There was a disposition.</li>
                    <li>The disposition was made not more than six months prior to the sequestration</li>
                    <li>The disposition was made in favour of a creditor of the insolvent</li>
                    <li>The effect of the disposition was that the creditor who has received the benefit was preferred above other creditors</li>
                    <li>The insolvent’s liabilities exceeded his assets immediately after the disposition.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>There are two defences namely:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The disposition was done in the normal conduct of business.</li>
                    <li>There was no intention of preferring the creditor who has received the benefit</li>
                </ul>
                Should you prove these two defences, it is deemed that there was no legal voidable preference.

        <div id="undue-preference-meaning" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                Many clients have told me that they heard “of a magical six months which applies to the disposition of assets”. According to this rumour, any disposition made prior to a period of six months preceding
                the sequestration is “safe”. This is complete and utter nonsense. Section 30 of the Insolvency Act specifies that, should the trustee prove that:
                <ul>
                    <li>There was a disposition at any time when his liabilities exceeded his assets; and</li>
                    <li>The insolvent had the intention of preferring one creditor above the other.</li>
                </ul>
                If all the above elements are present, then the disposition can be set aside irrespective of how long ago the disposition was made.
                <br />
                Under Section 30 there is no specific time period limiting its application to a specific time frame. The effect of a disposition under Section 30 is of lesser importance and the Court considers the 
                “intention to prefer” the creditor. In the matter of Pretorius N.O. versus Stock Owners Corporation, the Court determined that the trustee, should he have no direct evidence that the insolvent intended
                to prefer one creditor over the other, must prove that the insolvent has considered sequestration at the time of the disposition.

        <div id="collusion-meaning" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                The most import element of Section 31 is that the insolvent must have colluded with someone else when disposing of his assets. This is very logical. Should any person pass his assets to another person
                there will always be at least two parties involved. The insolvent must have colluded with someone else to dispose of his assets in such a manner that it would prejudice his creditors. There must have
                been a secret agreement. Section 31(1) stipulates “…… the Court can set aside such legal action”. In the case of Gert de Jager (Pty) Ltd versus Jones N.O. the Court decided that the trustee must prove
                that the parties who have colluded with the insolvent must have known that the debtor was insolvent and that other creditors would be prejudiced or that an undue benefit was created for a creditor. 
                Someone who is involved in such collusion is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Liable for the damages that the insolvent estate has incurred because of this disposition;</li>
                    <li>Forfeits his claim against the insolvent estate; and</li>
                    <li>He can be fined with an amount equal to the benefit he would have enjoyed, should the disposition not have been set aside.</li>

                No, when you are sequestrated, the debt vests in the trustee who must then sell the assets and distribute the funds amongst the creditors. In layman’s terms, when you are sequestrated your debt is
                written off and thus none of your old creditors can ever enforce payment of “old debt”. However, ln legal terms your debt is not written off when you are sequestrated and is only settled upon your
                rehabilitation.

                Before you can fully and properly partake in commerce you must be rehabilitated. Banks will not allow you to open cheque accounts, credit cards, or to borrow money to purchase a property, car etc.
                unless you are rehabilitated. The further problem is that, until your rehabilitation, every asset that you acquire during sequestration vests in your insolvent estate.

                if you have bought a house, you must, when applying for rehabilitation, request the court to grant an order in terms whereof the property vest in your “new” estate. If you have bought household

                The Registrar of the High Court must send a copy of the rehabilitation order to the credit bureaus who must then remove your adverse credit information. However, every so often the credit bureaus fail
                or neglect to do so or the information is never sent to the credit bureaus. As an added service, we attend to clearance of our clients records at ITC (Trans-Union), Compuscan, Experian and XDS when
                undertaking their rehabilitation. The general rule is that the credit bureaus update their information within twenty-one business days after receiving the rehabilitation order from us. However, this
                is not always the case and sometimes the clearing of a client’s credit record is more difficult than any part of the entire sequestration. This is mainly due to the credit bureaus constantly changing
                their requirements to remove information or removal of judgements on your credit profile which were listed after the sequestration date are particularly problematic. If this does occur it could take us
                months to clear your name, but rest assured that we will do all in our power to have our your name restored as soon as possible. We sometimes literally spend hours on the phone with the credit bureaus
                in order to clear your name. The process should take at the most thirty days, but sometimes takes as long as three or four months.

                <br />
                <strong><u>Section 61 “Protection against discrimination in respect of credit”</u></strong>
                <br />
                <strong>Section 61(1)</strong>: Relative to the treatment of any consumer or prospective consumer, a credit provider must not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against any natural person, juristic person or
                association of persons on one or more grounds set out in Section 9(3) of the Constitution, or on one or more grounds set out in Chapter 2 of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair

                <br />
                A credit provider may determine for itself any scoring or other evaluative mechanism or model to be used in managing, underwriting and pricing credit risk, provided that any such mechanism or model
                is not founded or structured upon a statistical or other analysis in which the basis of risk categorization, differentiation or assessment is a ground of unfair discrimination prohibited in Section
                9(3) of the Constitution. <br />
                <strong>Section 61(5) is problematic, but, in my opinion, to prove that the bank discriminates against you, you convince the Court that the bank has in the past granted finance to any other customer who was

            <strong>(a)</strong> refusing to enter into a credit agreement with that consumer;<br />
            <strong>(b)</strong> offering the consumer a lower credit limit under a credit facility than applied for by the consumer, or reducing the credit limit under an existing credit facility;<br />

                No, not necessarily but reducing tax liabilities are always one of the aims when setting up structures. Corporate structure and tax strategy are the opposite sides of the same coin and many corporate
                structures do however result in reduced tax liability.

                to bridge the gap between idea and operation. This is where most businesses fail. If you start sailing and reach the middle of the dam, but you do not have enough petrol to reach the other side,
                you are worse off than when you started. Rupert says that once you reach the other side of the pond you need to do three things right in that company namely marketing, management and pricing.

                For lack of a better term, the trustees are like the “managers” of the trust. Their position is comparable to that of a member of a close corporation or a Director of a Company. They don’t own the
                trust assets. They merely have control/possession of it and must manage it according to the rules specified in the Trust Deed.

                In terms of the Trust Property Control Act the trustees must upon registration of the trust open a bank account. My advice is to only open a bank account if the trust handles cash. If the trust
                only holds assets and no cash it is not in the interest of the trust to open a bank account because you will waste money on banking fees. I don’t think any court of law will frown upon this.

                transferring assets to a trust are the following:

                    <li>Whether you are solvent / insolvent at the time of the transfer</li>

                All your assets! The idea is that all your assets be held in trust, or in companies of which the shares are held by trust, but it is not always obtainable because of the fact that you must pay your
                silent partner, the government, transfer duties on for example the transfer of immovable properties or the transfer of shares of companies which are deemed to be “property companies”.

                If your child becomes the owner of your assets, you create a Pandora’s Box. Your child can be sequestrated, and then your assets fall into his insolvent estate. Your child can for example not transfer
                immovable property until he has come of age. Should your child want to sell the property you must get permission from the Master of the High Court. If your child divorces, his/her spouse can lay claim
                to part of his assets (as well as your assets which are now in his name). If your child is sued by his creditors and they take judgment against him, the Sheriff can also sell your assets which are in
                his name. Another problem in our law is that principle of “estoppels”. According to the rules of Estoppel, if it is convenient to pretend that your assets are actually your child’s assets, and you later
                find that it is inconvenient to keep up this pretence that fiction which you created works against you.

                is not the correct way to setup a trust as a trust is client specific and different requirements must be considered from one client to the next. Our trust deeds are revised annually, and we have

                don’t keep a proper record of the transactions of the trust. If you do not keep a proper record, you cannot prove that the assets belong to the trust. There must always be a money trail and a paper
                trail of the trust’s transactions.

                A very important aspect, which is neglected by many taxpayers, is the IB40 tax form. The IB40 must be submitted to SARS by any person, trust, person/trust/company/CC who has received a donation.
                The advantage of submitting the IB40 is that you in future have proof that the donation was indeed made and that it was made during a specific tax year.

            <p>
                The liquidation of a Company / Close Corporation is a legal process whereby the Company and its affairs are placed under the control of a liquidator who must realize the assets and divide
                the assets amongst creditors according to the provisions in the Companies Act. The main aim of liquidation is to divide the yield from the sale of assets amongst creditors equally and to
                dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.

            <p>
                “Sequestration”, “bankruptcy” “insolvency” and “liquidation” are all different terms, which in layman’s terms simply mean that a person or business is in such a bad financial state that
                creditors cannot get paid. The term “liquidation” refers to the insolvency of a company or close corporation. The term “sequestration” refers to the insolvency of a natural person or a trust. 
                “Surrender of estate” refers to the process whereby a natural person approaches the court to be declared insolvent.

                Most people believe that these terms are all synonyms and they are used interchangeably. However, each one of these terms have a specific legal meaning and place in our law. Once a natural
                person is sequestrated the Master of the High Court appoints a Trustee who must take control of the assets. In the case of a Company/CC liquidation, the person appointed by the Master is
                referred to as a Liquidator. A Curator can either be appointed as a guardian of the assets of an institution like an Art Gallery/Museum or he can be appointed as guardian of a person who
                does not have the mental capacity to take care of their own financial affairs. The term Curator is often mistakenly used when referring to a Trustee or Liquidator.

            <p>
                Be very careful when considering consolidation, because it could push your company deeper into debt. Consolidation works best by consolidating short term debt into a long term loan (For example: if your
                company registers a bond on a property to settle credit cards, overdrafts, business loans, vehicles and loans). However, the usual problem encountered with consolidation is that, by the time you try to
                consolidate the debt, you are already listed with the credit bureaus and do not qualify for further loans. Be careful to bail out your company, using personal finances, if your company is not sure it
                will be able to pay you back.

            <p>

                “payment holiday”. This process only succeeds if you can dangle a very nice fat carrot in front of the donkey, such as a policy paying out soon and the funds will be enough to cover the debt or you are
                in the process of transferring a property which will be able to settle the debt due upon registration. Creditors typically only enter into a moratorium agreement if they are certain that they will get paid.
                Keep in mind that when you negotiate with a creditor, the creditor only wants two questions answered, namely: When will you pay them and how much?

            <p>
                The liquidation of a Company / Close Corporation is a legal process whereby the Company and its affairs are placed under the control of a liquidator who must realize the assets and divide the
                assets amongst creditors according to the provisions in the Companies Act. The main aim of liquidation is to divide the yield from the sale of assets amongst creditors equally and to dissolve
                the Company in an orderly manner.

                If your company/CC is unable to pay its debt, deregistration is precisely what you don’t want to do because, if it is deregistered, the directors become personally liable for the company’s debt

                The purpose of a Section 155 compromise is to reach a binding agreement between the shareholders and creditors of the company with a view to modify their claims against the company in the common
                interest of all parties concerned. Section 155, therefore, creates the machinery which enables the company to negotiate with members of a group of shareholders and/or creditors collectively and
                combine all the members of that group to the agreement reached by the majority of members of that group. The main aim is to rearrange the company’s liabilities. This mechanism is typically used
                by large companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The compromise must be agreed upon by a majority in a number of creditors who must represent at least 75% in value of the debt owed by the company. Furthermore, at least 75% of the shareholders
                must agree to the arrangement. A scheme can take many forms. Even companies who are not insolvent can apply for Section 155 if this would help the company to become more profitable. It is a rather
                involved process and we will advise you on this.

                The short answer is that you will keep the car until the liquidator is appointed, shortly after liquidation. During the liquidation process, all execution steps stop. Once the company has been liquidated and the
                liquidator has been appointed, the creditors would generally want their assets back immediately.

                If your company/ CC doesn’t pay its debt, the creditor must first send a letter of demand. Thereafter summons is issued and if your company does not have a valid defence, judgement is granted against
                the company. The judgement does not mean that the creditor has money in his pocket and the next step is for the creditor to follow execution steps against the company. The creditor can firstly attach
                movable assets, thereafter immovable assets and thereafter money owed to your company such as the surrender value on an insurance policy or the value of an investment that your company has with a
                financial institution. Should the creditor not succeed in collecting the money in this manner he can summons you in your representative capacity to appear in the Magistrate Court where a financial
                enquiry is held. At such an inquiry you must produce your company’s bank statements, financials etc. The Court can then make an Order that your company’s pay the creditor a certain amount per month.

            <p>
                Depending on the facts of the case a liquidation can be made either directly through CIPC or via a Court application. Make an appointment with us. During consultation, we will assist you in determining
                whether Liquidation is indeed the right option for your business. Should we proceed with liquidation, there are a lot of legal formalities which we take care of. The CIPC liquidation is a relatively
                quick process in that it typically would take about two to four weeks to finalise as compared to a court application which typically takes about 5 weeks before we appear in Court and get the provisional
                Liquidation order. You don’t have to appear in person and during the process, we negotiate with creditors. Legally the creditors can carry on with execution until the provisional liquidation order is
                granted. Do not leave the matter so late that we cannot stop execution by your creditors.

                creditor you will have to disclose to the creditor that you have left him out and worst-case you might have to approach the court again to condone the oversight.

                The South African Parliament has adopted the cross-border insolvency Act No 42 of 2000 which states that, you must notify any international creditors if you apply for liquidation in South Africa. They
                have the same rights as the South African creditors. With regards to the company’s assets in that country, they form part of the insolvent estate and the liquidator may apply to the competent court in
                that country to have the liquidation order extended to that country. Once a company is liquidated all of its assets, irrespective of where they are located, form part of the estate and fall under the

            <p>
                There is a schedule that forms part of the Insolvency Act which prescribes that the liquidator gets paid from the sale of the assets in the estate. This schedule, inter alia, provides for fees of 3% from the
                sale of immovable property, 10% from the sale of movable assets, 1% of cash in the estate etc. When a company is liquidated and it has no assets it creates a problem because it costs the liquidator a substantial
                amount to wind up the estate even if there are no assets. In these circumstances a contribution may levied and we always advise our clients to pay the liquidators fee and expenses because the liquidator does not
                want to incur losses in the winding up progress.

                The urban myth goes as follows: You can dispose of any asset and then wait for a period of six months, then Liquidate and the disposal is safe. This is absolute and utter hogwash. There is another urban
                legend which says that if you have ten creditors and you don’t treat them equal when paying them, in other words, you prefer one or more creditor above the others when it comes to payment, you simply have
                to wait six months where after the creditor (normally your father, brother, wife or son) who was preferred above the other creditors are safe. This is a fairy tale. In the FAQ’s that are answered hereunder

                Certain acts by an insolvent in terms whereof he has disposed of assets prior to liquidation are known as “voidable dispositions”. A “disposition” in laymen’s terms means that you have gotten rid of an asset
                by donating it to someone, selling it, registering it on someone else’s name, lawfully or unlawfully dealing with it in such a way that the value decreases, destroying it or allow someone to acquire a legal

                    <li>Dispositions without value, (Section 26 of the Insolvency Act).</li>

        <div id="what-is-disposition-without-value" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                <strong>Certain legal actions by an insolvent prior to his sequestration are defined as a disposition without value</strong>. This type of transaction can be set aside by the liquidator and the assets which were
                disposed of can be repossessed by the liquidator.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main feature of such a disposition is that there was no legal obligation on the insolvent to dispose of the asset. An example is where you would simply transfer an asset to someone who did
                not have a legal claim on the asset. Should a liquidator wish to set aside such a disposition, the liquidator must prove that:
            <ul>
                <li>the insolvent has of his own free will disposed of the asset;</li>
                <li>that the disposition was made in favour of another person; and</li>
                <li>the insolvent received no or insufficient quid pro quo for the asset.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a liquidator is appointed, he should determine whether dispositions were made. If these dispositions were made, he must determine whether the disposition was made within two years before the
                sequestration or longer ago than two years. If the disposition was made more than two years ago, the liquidator must prove that the insolvent’s assets were less than his liabilities directly after
                the disposition and he must also prove that the insolvent did not receive a proper quid pro quo for the transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the disposition was made within two years before sequestration, the burden of proof that the disposal cannot be set aside vests in the insolvent and/or the person who has received the benefit.
                They must prove that either the insolvent’s assets exceeded his liabilities directly after the disposition, failing which, he must prove that he has received a proper counter value when disposing of
                the asset. Section 26 does not try to inhibit the normal conduct of business. It prohibits extraordinary transactions.

            <p>
                Should the liquidator prove that there was a voidable disposition, the disposition becomes nil and void. Section 29 envisages a proper pro rata division of the assets of the insolvent amongst his creditors.
                A disposition of Section 29 differs from a disposition in terms of Section 26 in that the disposition under Section 29 has been made to one of the insolvent’s creditors, whereas a disposition under Section
                26 has been made to someone who was not a creditor of the insolvent. If a liquidator wishes to succeed in setting aside such a disposition, he must prove the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>There was a disposition;</li>
                    <li>The disposition was made not more than six months prior to the sequestration;</li>
                    <li>The disposition was made in favour of a creditor of the insolvent;</li>
                    <li>The effect of the disposition was that the creditor who has received the benefit was preferred above other creditors;</li>
                    <li>The insolvent’s liabilities exceeded his assets immediately after the disposition.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong><u>here are two defences namely:</u></strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The disposition was done in the normal conduct of business</li>
                    <li>There was no intention of preferring the creditor who has received the benefit.
                        Should you prove these two defences, it is deemed that there was no legal voidable preference.</li>

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-block faq-content-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#undue-preference">What does undue preference (Section 30) mean?</button>
        <div id="undue-preference" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                Many clients have told me that they heard “of a magical six months which applies to the disposition of assets”. According to this rumour, any disposition made prior to a period of six months preceding the
                sequestration is “safe”. This is complete and utter nonsense. Section 30 of the Insolvency Act specifies that, should the liquidator prove that:
                <ul>
                    <li>There was a disposition at any time when his liabilities exceeded his assets; and</li>
                    <li>The insolvent had the intention of preferring one creditor above the other.</li>
                </ul>
                If all the above elements are present, then the disposition can be set aside irrespective of how long ago the disposition was made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under Section 30 there is no specific time period limiting its application to a specific time frame. The effect of a disposition under Section 30 is of lesser importance and the Court considers the 
                “intention to prefer” the creditor. In the matter of Pretorius N.O. versus Stock Owners Corporation, the Court determined that the liquidator, should he have no direct evidence that the insolvent
                intended to prefer one creditor over the other, must prove that the insolvent has considered sequestration at the time of the disposition.

        <div id="collusion" class="collapse faq-content">
            <p>
                The most import element of Section 31 is that the insolvent must have colluded with someone else when disposing of his assets. This is very logical. Should any person pass his assets to another person
                there will always be at least two parties involved. The insolvent must have colluded with someone else to dispose of his assets in such a manner that it would prejudice his creditors. There must have
                been a secret agreement. Section 31(1) stipulates “…… the Court can set aside such legal action”. In the case of Gert de Jager (Pty) Ltd versus Jones N.O. the Court decided that the trustee must prove
                that the parties who have colluded with the insolvent must have known that the debtor was insolvent and that other creditors would be prejudiced or that an undue benefit was created for a creditor. 
                Someone who is involved in such collusion is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Liable for the damages that the insolvent estate has incurred because of this disposition;</li>

                    <li>He can be fined with an amount equal to the benefit he would have enjoyed, should the disposition not have been set aside.</li>

                Be very careful when considering consolidation, because it could push your company deeper into debt. Consolidation works best by consolidating short term debt into a long term loan (For example: if your
                company registers a bond on a property to settle credit cards, overdrafts, business loans, vehicles and loans). However, the usual problem encountered with consolidation is that, by the time you try to
                consolidate the debt, you are already listed with the credit bureaus and do not qualify for further loans. Be careful to bail out your company, using personal finances, if your company is not sure it
                will be able to pay you back.

                documents including a summons. There after it is legally accepted that you have received the summons at that address, whether you still live there or not. The service was legal, and the judgement taken is also legal.

                All cheques post-dated to date after liquidation becomes void and the creditor who has received such a cheque becomes a normal creditor for the amounts not honoured. Cheques that were due and payable before the
                date of liquidation is a different story. Should you have issued cheques which were dishonored it can be deemed that you acted fraudulently, and the creditor can charge the member/director criminally. But, if you
                have issued a cheque with the reasonable expectation that the cheque would be honoured and something contrary to your expectation occurred, the creditor is burdened to prove all the elements of a crime, which will
                be very difficult.

                        and you can receive fifteen years jail time for submitting false information. It is “less worse” to not submit forms or to submit forms without payment than to submit forms with fraudulent

                Section 415 & 417 of the Companies Act stipulates that your liquidator (under the instruction of one or more creditors) can hold an insolvency inquiry. The aim of an insolvency inquiry is to obtain
                information about your company’s insolvent estate should you not have made full disclosure, or should you have hidden assets and the liquidator finds out about it. The Act permits the liquidator to
                subpoena yourself, family members, employees as well as any person who has information about the insolvent estate. If you are subpoenaed to appear in an insolvency inquiry and you refuse or fail to
                attend the inquiry, you can be arrested and charged criminally.

                you are not allowed to sell the property during the liquidation process. Once appointed, the liquidator must elect whether or not to proceed with the agreement to sell the property.

            <p>
                The general rule is that the share registered in the company name forms part of the insolvent estate. The liquidator must sell all the assets of the insolvent estate. In practice, the person/s who owns
                the “other undivided share” in the immovable property is typically the purchaser. This is because he/she has signed surety for the full outstanding bond jointly and severally with the company when the
                property was originally purchased. The alternative is that the property is sold, and the proceeds are distributed equally between the joint owners and the insolvent estate. This could be confusing and

            <p>
                Typically, the liquidator who has the most support from the creditors is appointed. This transpires on the basis that he must have rallied the support of creditors in number and value. “Number”
                being the number of creditors and “value” being the value of the debt. For example, if you have ten creditors and a certain liquidator has rallied the support of the majority of creditors he will
                be appointed. If the liquidator was also supported in value, for example, the total debt is R100,000.00 and the liquidator has the support of creditors who’s claims amount to R50,001.00, that liquidator
                will be appointed. Therefore, the possibility does exist that two liquidators can be appointed in one estate.

                According to section 143 of the Act, the Minister will publish BRPs’ tariffs and fees in the Government Gazette. The BRP may propose an agreement different from the tariffs published in the Gazette, which
                must be approved by the majority of “persons with a voting interest”, in terms whereof, additional to the Gazette tariff, he will be remunerated on performance, take equity in the company etc. The BRP’s
                remuneration must be voted on at a meeting convened for that purpose. The BRP’s remuneration and expenses rank in priority before all other claims. A creditor or shareholder who voted against the BRP’s
                remuneration may, within 10 business days after the meeting, approach court for an order setting aside the agreement. The court will set the agreement aside if convinced that:
                <ul>

                The appointed BRP is an officer of the court and takes over full control from the board of directors. He may remove any person from his position and appoint another person in his place. The BRP
                must investigate the Companies affairs, business, property, and financial situation and determine if there is a reasonable prospect of rescuing the company. If there is no reasonable prospect of
                rescuing the company, he must inform the court, the company and all affected persons, discontinue the business, where after the company must be liquidated. The plan must be compiled under four headings;
                Background, Proposals, Assumptions and Conditions. Notice of this (first) meeting must be given to all creditors, trade unions, and creditors (they must be obviously notified of time, date, place and agenda).
                Once the company is out of its financial difficulty, he must notify the court, the company, and all affected persons, and apply to the court for the termination of the Rescue Order.

                The Companies Act places an onus on the directors of a company to act. They must do something if the board of directors of a company have reasonable grounds to believe that the company is financially distressed,

                not put filing for liquidation of business rescue.

                Directors must exercise their duties subject to the authority of the BRP, attend to the BRP’s requests and provide the BRP with information. Any actions taken by directors without the consent of the BRP, where
                consent was needed, are void. Directors who do not comply with any of the above conditions can be removed from office by an application to the court by the BRP.
