    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#insolvency-inquiry">What is an insolvency inquiry?</button>
    <div id="insolvency-inquiry" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            Section 65 of the Insolvency Act determines that your trustee (under the instruction of one or more creditors) can hold an insolvency inquiry. <strong>The aim of an insolvency inquiry is to obtain
            information about your insolvent estate should if you have not made a full disclosure or have hidden assets from your trustee or creditors</strong>. The Act allows the trustee to subpoena any person
            who has information about your insolvent estate. If you are subpoenaed to appear in an insolvency inquiry and you refuse or fail to attend the inquiry, you can be charged criminally.
        </p>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#voidable-dispositions">What are the so called <i>voidable dispositions</i> ?</button>
    <div id="voidable-dispositions" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            Certain acts by an insolvent in terms whereof he has disposed of assets prior to sequestration are known as “voidable dispositions”. A “disposition” in laymen’s terms means that you have gotten rid
            of an asset by donating it, selling it, registering it in someone else’s name, lawfully or unlawfully dealing with it in such a way that the value decreases, destroying it or allow someone to acquire
            a legal right over the asset which right is stronger than the claims of creditors.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#safe-dispositions">I have heard that all dispositions that I have made more than six months before my sequestration are safe. Is this true?</button>
    <div id="safe-dispositions" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            The myth is that you can dispose of any asset and wait six months, sequestrate, and the disposal is safe. <strong>This is complete rubbish and downright reckless advice</strong>. In the FAQ’s below, we deal thoroughly
            with this myth.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#voidable-dispositions-categories">What are the categories of <i>voidable dispositions</i> ?</button>
    <div id="voidable-dispositions-categories" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            There are 5 categories of voidable dispositions, namely:
        <ul>
            <li>Dispositions without value, (Section 26 of the Insolvency Act).</li>
            <li>Voidable Preferences (Section 29 of the Act).</li>
            <li>Undue preferences (Section 30 of the Act) including certain dealings in terms of an Antenuptial Contract (Section 27 of the Act).</li>
            <li>Voidable transfer of business (Section 34 of the Insolvency Act).</li>
            <li>Collusive dealings (Section 31 of the Act) are not voidable disposals as such; it intends to punish those who assisted you in hiding assets.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#disposition-without-value">What is a disposition without value? (Section 26)</button>
    <div id="disposition-without-value" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            Certain legal actions by an insolvent prior to his sequestration are defined as a disposition without value. This type of transaction can be set aside by the trustee and the assets which were disposed
            of can be repossessed by the trustee. The main feature of such a disposition is that there was no legal obligation on the insolvent to dispose of the asset. An example is where you would simply transfer
            an asset to someone who did not have a legal claim on the asset. Should a trustee wish to set aside such a disposition, the trustee must prove that:
        <ul>
            <li>the insolvent has of his own free will disposed of the asset;</li>
            <li>that the disposition was made in favour of another person; and</li>
            <li>he insolvent received no or insufficient quid pro quo for the asset.</li>
        </ul>
        Once a trustee is appointed he should determine whether dispositions were made. If these dispositions were made, the trustee must determine whether the disposition was made within two years before the
        sequestration or longer ago than two years. If the disposition was made more than two years ago, the trustee must prove that the insolvent’s assets were less than his liabilities directly after the
        disposition and he must also prove that the insolvent did not receive a proper quid pro quo for the transaction.
        <br />
        If the disposition was made within two years before sequestration, the burden of proof that the disposal cannot be set aside vests in the insolvent and/or the person who has received the benefit.
        They must prove that either the insolvent’s assets exceeded his liabilities directly after the disposition, failing which, he must prove that he has received a proper counter value when disposing of
        the asset. Section 26 does not try to inhibit the normal conduct of business. It prohibits extraordinary transactions.
        </p>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#dealings-antenuptial-contract">Certain dealings in terms of an Antenuptial Contract (Section 27)</button>
    <div id="dealings-antenuptial-contract" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            It is common practice for spouses to make donations to each other in terms of Antenuptial contracts. All donations made in terms of a prenuptial contract can be set aside unless the spouse who has
            received the benefit from his/her insolvent spouse proves the following:
        <ul>
            <li>The donation in terms of the prenuptial contract brought an immediate benefit to the solvent spouse within three months after the date of marriage; and</li>
            <li>The benefit has passed in terms of a properly registered prenuptial contract; and</li>
            <li>The benefit was given in good faith to a spouse or a child from the marriage; and</li>
            <li>The insolvent’s estate is not sequestrated within two years after the disposition in terms of the prenuptial contract was made. Should you be able to prove all the above, it is deemed that
                there was no legal disposition made.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#voidable-preference-meaning">What does voidable preference mean? (Section 29)</button>
    <div id="voidable-preference-meaning" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            Should the trustee prove that there was a voidable disposition, the disposition becomes nil and void. Section 29 envisages a proper pro rata division of the assets of the insolvent amongst his creditors.
            A disposition of Section 29 differs from a disposition in terms of Section 26 in that the disposition under Section 29 has been made to one of the insolvent’s creditors, whereas a disposition under
            Section 26 has been made to someone who was not a creditor of the insolvent. If a trustee wishes to succeed in setting aside such a disposition, he must prove the following:
        <ul>
            <li>There was a disposition.</li>
            <li>The disposition was made not more than six months prior to the sequestration</li>
            <li>The disposition was made in favour of a creditor of the insolvent</li>
            <li>The effect of the disposition was that the creditor who has received the benefit was preferred above other creditors</li>
            <li>The insolvent’s liabilities exceeded his assets immediately after the disposition.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>There are two defences namely:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The disposition was done in the normal conduct of business.</li>
            <li>There was no intention of preferring the creditor who has received the benefit</li>
        </ul>
        Should you prove these two defences, it is deemed that there was no legal voidable preference.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#undue-preference-meaning">What does Undue preference (Section 30) mean?</button>
    <div id="undue-preference-meaning" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            Many clients have told me that they heard “of a magical six months which applies to the disposition of assets”. According to this rumour, any disposition made prior to a period of six months preceding
            the sequestration is “safe”. This is complete and utter nonsense. Section 30 of the Insolvency Act specifies that, should the trustee prove that:
        <ul>
            <li>There was a disposition at any time when his liabilities exceeded his assets; and</li>
            <li>The insolvent had the intention of preferring one creditor above the other.</li>
        </ul>
        If all the above elements are present, then the disposition can be set aside irrespective of how long ago the disposition was made.
        <br />
        Under Section 30 there is no specific time period limiting its application to a specific time frame. The effect of a disposition under Section 30 is of lesser importance and the Court considers the 
        “intention to prefer” the creditor. In the matter of Pretorius N.O. versus Stock Owners Corporation, the Court determined that the trustee, should he have no direct evidence that the insolvent intended
        to prefer one creditor over the other, must prove that the insolvent has considered sequestration at the time of the disposition.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-block faq-main-button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collusion-meaning">What does <i>collusion</i> mean? (Section 31)</button>
    <div id="collusion-meaning" class="collapse faq-content">
        <p>
            The most import element of Section 31 is that the insolvent must have colluded with someone else when disposing of his assets. This is very logical. Should any person pass his assets to another person
            there will always be at least two parties involved. The insolvent must have colluded with someone else to dispose of his assets in such a manner that it would prejudice his creditors. There must have
            been a secret agreement. Section 31(1) stipulates “…… the Court can set aside such legal action”. In the case of Gert de Jager (Pty) Ltd versus Jones N.O. the Court decided that the trustee must prove
            that the parties who have colluded with the insolvent must have known that the debtor was insolvent and that other creditors would be prejudiced or that an undue benefit was created for a creditor. 
            Someone who is involved in such collusion is:
        <ul>
            <li>Liable for the damages that the insolvent estate has incurred because of this disposition;</li>
            <li>Forfeits his claim against the insolvent estate; and</li>
            <li>He can be fined with an amount equal to the benefit he would have enjoyed, should the disposition not have been set aside.</li>
        </ul>
