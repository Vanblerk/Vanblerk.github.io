        For most people, owning a property will be their biggest and most important investment and therefore it is best to obtain legal assistance to ensure that your
        interests are protected and that your transaction is efficiently concluded when planning to buy, sell or lease a property. If you are a first-time home buyer
        and new to the home buying process, you may not be familiar with the conveyancing process, which parties are involved and who pays what. The earlier you speak
        to a Conveyancer, the better, as they can help you look over the contracts and give you advice. A Conveyancer will clarify the importance of each process to
        help all the parties understand exactly what is involved, the documents required in terms of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA), why certain documents
        are required and what documentation you are signing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working with a conveyancer will ensure you meet all of your legal obligations while transferring your property. At JJ Pepler Inc we will guide you through
        the conveyancing process step-by-step, from start to finish and make sure you are informed throughout the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ownership of immovable property is not obtained by signature of the offer to purchase or even upon payment of the purchase price. Ownership is only obtained
        after registration of the property into the buyer's name at the Deeds Registry Office. Conveyancing is the legal process that takes place when lawful ownership
        is obtained of immovable property. Each time a property is sold; a new deed of transfer must be drawn up and registered. This is to ensure the security and
        certainty of an owner's title to his property.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>We provide the following specialised services:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Drafting of various agreements related to property transfer</li>
        <li>Advising parties on the content of an Offer to Purchase</li>
        <li>Transfer of immovable property from the seller to the buyer</li>
        <li>Registration of and Cancellation of bonds over a property</li>
        <li>Assisting clients with back-to-back transactions</li>
        <li>Transfer from deceased estates</li>
        <li>Drafting of and advice on leases</li>
        <li>Transfer of one-half share of a property in terms of divorce settlement or deceased estate</li>
        <li>Advising and assisting clients with the transfer of property for estate planning or tax purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>There are usually three conveyancing attorneys involved during the property transfer process:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>The “Transferring Attorneys”</strong> transfer the property from the seller to the buyer and as they are usually appointed by the seller,
            the transferring attorneys represent the seller and protects his/her interests.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The “Registering / Bond Attorneys”</strong> are responsible for registering the bond over the property in favour of the bank that is
            financing the purchase of the property. They represent the buyer and the bank granting the buyer's home loan and are appointed by the bank.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The “Cancellation Attorneys”</strong> are responsible for cancelling the seller's existing bond on the property. They represent the bank
            cancelling the seller's home loan and as such are appointed by the seller’s existing bondholder.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <br />

    <h3>What can you expect from your conveyancer?</h3>
    <p>
        The Conveyancer should:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Protect the interest of his client at all times and these interests should outweigh all other considerations except of course issues of legality</li>
        <li>Inform the parties of the conveyancing procedure and keep them informed of the progress of the transaction</li>
        <li>Advise the parties on the content of the Offer to Purchase, especially regarding suspensive conditions</li>
        <li>Advise the seller on the cancellation of his bond, any penalties, notice periods and other administrative charges which may affect the settlement figure</li>
        <li>Do everything in his power to register the transaction on or as close as possible to the date agreed to in the offer to purchase</li>
        <li>Advise the parties on their obligations in terms of the offer to purchase, so as to ensure that the transfer is not delayed</li>
        <li>Meet with the buyer and the seller to explain, as well as sign the necessary documentation in order to conclude the transaction</li>
        <li>Prepare the deeds for lodgement with care, so as to minimise the risk of rejection of the documentation by the Deeds Office</li>
        <li>Inform the parties of the transfer on the day of registration</li>
        <li>Account to the parties for finances relating to the transaction within two days after registration</li>
    </ul>
